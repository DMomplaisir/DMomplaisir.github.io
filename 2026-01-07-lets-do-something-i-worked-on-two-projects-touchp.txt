⏺ Done! Pushed to master (dfa1197). The GitHub Actions workflow will deploy the changes automatically.

  Note: GitHub flagged some dependency vulnerabilities - you may want to run npm audit and update packages when you have time, but it's not blocking the deploy.

⏺ Cleaned up the copy:

  Changes made:
  - Urbanism: More direct opener, tighter sentences, ends with clear through-line about understanding complex systems
  - Journalism: Added proper subject ("I learned"), included concrete numbers (1,200 → 10,000), clearer cause-effect
  - Engineering: Dropped the clunky "shows up in how I think about" phrasing, more natural connection to urbanism

  Want me to commit this, or would you like to tweak it further?

> i think there's certain level of poetry, poeticness to describing my work 
i'd like can you give me a set of options 
                                                                           
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which tone feels right for the Urbanism section? → Spare + evocative
     · Which tone for the Journalism section? → Story-forward
     · Which tone for the Engineering section? → Clean connection

⏺ Great choices - spare + evocative, story-forward, clean connection. Let me update:

⏺ Done. The timeline now reads with more rhythm and intentionality:

  - Urbanism: Opens with a fragment ("Caribbean Queens."), builds through observation, lands on the core question
  - Journalism: Clear arc—discovery, action, lesson learned
  - Engineering: Ties it together without over-explaining
