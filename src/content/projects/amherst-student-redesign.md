## Context

The Amherst Student, founded in 1868, is one of the nation's oldest college newspapers. As Digital Director from 2018-2021, I led the complete digital transformation of the publication, growing readership from 1,200 to 10,000 monthly users while managing a team of six focused on digital strategy.

**Timeline:** June 2018 - June 2021
**Team:** Team of six, focused on digital strategy and development
**Scope:** Full platform migration, ML-powered archival system, newsletter strategy

## Challenge

How do you modernize a 150-year-old institution's digital presence while making decades of archival content discoverable and maintaining editorial excellence?

### Key Problems

1. **Legacy Technology Stack**
   Drupal-based CMS was difficult to maintain and limited our ability to ship new features quickly

2. **Archival Content Inaccessible**
   150 years of journalism was trapped in legacy systems with no effective way for readers to discover historical articles

3. **Declining Digital Engagement**
   Traditional college newspaper model wasn't resonating with modern student readership patterns

## Solution

Complete platform modernization with focus on performance, discoverability, and editorial workflow:

- **Next.js Migration**: Transitioned from Drupal to Next.js/React for faster development velocity and better performance
- **Machine Learning for Archives**: Implemented ML-powered search and recommendation system enabling readers to discover relevant archival content
- **Newsletter Strategy**: Built high-engagement newsletter program achieving 85-90% read rates through targeted content and segmentation
- **Editorial Tools**: Created streamlined publishing workflow reducing friction for student journalists

## Impact

**733% increase in readership** - Grew from 1,200 to 10,000 monthly users through improved UX and content strategy

**85-90% newsletter read rates** - Far exceeding industry averages through targeted content and engaged audience

**Archival content discovery** - ML-powered system made 150 years of journalism accessible and relevant to modern readers

**Team leadership** - Managed team of six in executing digital strategy and technical implementations

## Technical Details

The Next.js migration provided dramatic improvements in page load times and developer experience. The machine learning component used natural language processing to analyze archival articles and surface relevant content based on current events and reader interests.

*This project demonstrated how modern web technology and ML can breathe new life into legacy journalism institutions.*
