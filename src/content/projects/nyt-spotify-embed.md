## Context

During my summer 2019 internship at The New York Times, I worked on enhancing the digital reading experience by building rich media integrations for music journalism. The challenge was creating consistent Spotify embeds that worked across NYT's diverse platform ecosystem.

**Timeline:** June 2019 - August 2019
**Team:** NYT Interactive News team
**Scope:** Cross-platform component development, accessibility improvements

## Challenge

Music journalism at The Times needed better integration with Spotify to provide readers with immediate access to the music being discussed. The solution needed to work seamlessly across NYT's main site, AMP pages, and mobile apps while meeting strict accessibility standards.

### Key Problems

1. **Platform Fragmentation**
   NYT maintained three distinct platforms (main site, AMP, mobile) each with different technical constraints

2. **Accessibility Standards**
   All components needed to meet NYT's high accessibility standards for inclusive journalism

3. **Performance Constraints**
   Embeds couldn't slow down page load times, particularly on mobile and AMP

## Solution

Developed a cross-platform Spotify embed component with focus on consistency and accessibility:

- **Three-Platform Implementation**: Built Spotify embed working across main site, AMP pages, and mobile app with consistent user experience
- **Accessibility First**: Updated components to meet WCAG accessibility standards, ensuring music journalism was accessible to all readers
- **Podcast Player Collaboration**: Contributed to design and implementation of NYT's podcast player
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensured embeds loaded efficiently without impacting page performance

## Impact

**Cross-platform consistency** - Spotify embeds worked seamlessly across all NYT platforms, improving music journalism experience

**Accessibility compliance** - Components met a11y standards, making music content accessible to all readers

**Editorial enablement** - Music critics and journalists could easily integrate Spotify content into their stories

## Technical Details

The implementation required understanding three distinct technical stacks and ensuring the component worked within each platform's constraints. Special attention was paid to lazy loading, responsive design, and keyboard navigation for accessibility.

*This internship demonstrated the importance of cross-platform thinking and accessibility in modern web development.*
