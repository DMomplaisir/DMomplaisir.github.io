## The Brief

AI Watchdog needed to be a high-visibility editorial destination - a place where readers could track AI developments with The Atlantic's characteristic depth and perspective. The editorial team had ambitious interactive requirements, and we had 8 weeks to launch.

## My Role

I served as Technical Product Lead, coordinating with Editorial, Product, and Design through an intensive sprint. This meant:

- Translating editorial vision into technical requirements
- Continuous prototyping - often sharing progress nightly
- Enabling quick feedback loops between editorial insight and development
- Working with datasets I hadn't touched in years

## Technical Challenge

The project required working with Elasticsearch across datasets of 100 million+ creative works - tools more familiar to our Data Science partners than typical frontend work. I dove into functionality I hadn't touched in years to deliver the interactive experience editorial needed.

## What Made It Work

The architectural decisions we'd made for the Collections system paid off here. We could deliver an ambitious interactive experience without adding technical debt through custom page creation. The platform we'd built enabled rapid iteration.

**Agile development with editorial:** The continuous prototyping approach - sharing progress nightly - enabled a quicker feedback loop and produced something we could iterate on.

## Results

**7K+ unique visitors** - making it one of our most-visited landing pages.

**8-week sprint** from kickoff to September 2025 launch.

**No new technical debt** - leveraged existing Collections architecture.
