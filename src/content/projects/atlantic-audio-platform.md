## Context

At The Atlantic since June 2021, I've focused on building and scaling audio infrastructure that serves millions of listeners while modernizing the technical stack powering the publication's digital presence. The work spans from low-level audio engineering to high-touch product experiences.

**Timeline:** June 2021 - Present (4+ years)
**Team:** Product Engineering, working cross-functionally with editorial, design, and audio teams
**Scope:** Audio infrastructure, platform migration, product development

## Challenge

The Atlantic needed to modernize its technical infrastructure while dramatically improving audio engagement. The existing Django-based system was limiting product velocity, and audio experiences weren't meeting reader expectations or business goals.

### Key Problems

1. **Audio Engagement Below Potential**
   Article audio play rates were significantly below target despite growing listener demand

2. **Legacy Architecture Limiting Velocity**
   Django-based system made shipping new features slow and difficult, particularly for high-touch surfaces

3. **Platform Fragmentation**
   Need to maintain consistent experiences across web, mobile, and emerging platforms

## Solution

Led multiple parallel initiatives modernizing The Atlantic's technical platform and audio infrastructure:

- **Audio Infrastructure Rearchitecture**: Spearheaded technical rearchitecture of audio platform with native player, improving performance and user experience
- **Next.js/GraphQL Migration**: Led migration of high-touch surfaces from Django to Next.js and GraphQL, enabling faster development velocity and better performance
- **Holy Week Digital Experience**: Shipped immersive digital experience for Holy Week podcast, combining audio with interactive storytelling
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Maintained consistency across web, mobile, and emerging platforms while iterating rapidly

## Impact

**Nearly doubled article play rates** - Dramatic improvement in audio engagement through infrastructure improvements and UX optimization

**Faster product velocity** - Next.js migration enabled significantly faster iteration cycles for new features and experiments

**Scalable infrastructure** - Platform now reliably serves millions of monthly listeners with improved performance

**Editorial impact** - Holy Week digital experience showcased new possibilities for immersive audio journalism

## Technical Details

The platform modernization involved migrating critical surfaces from Django to Next.js with GraphQL data layer, providing better performance and developer experience. Audio infrastructure work focused on building a robust native player with improved reliability, analytics, and cross-platform consistency.

*This ongoing work demonstrates full-stack engineering, infrastructure design, and product leadership in a high-scale journalism environment.*
