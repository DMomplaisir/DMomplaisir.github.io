## The Problem

The Atlantic's content organization system had grown organically over years. Sections, channels, projects - each taxonomy type had its own implementation, its own quirks, its own technical debt. Creating a new landing page meant custom development. Editors couldn't build the pages they needed without engineering involvement.

## The Solution

I authored the RFC and led implementation of a comprehensive CMS rearchitecture - a unified Collections system that replaced all legacy taxonomy pages with a flexible, scalable approach.

**The key insight:** All our taxonomies were variations of the same concept - a curated group of content with a landing page. Sections, channels, projects, special reports - they all needed the same capabilities. Why maintain separate systems?

## Technical Approach

<!-- TODO: Add details about the technical implementation -->

## Results

**200+ reader-facing pages** now powered by the Collections system.

**66+ pull requests** spanning the entire frontend suite over six months.

**"One model to rule them all"** - engineers can now abstract organizational structure into a single unified model.

**Advertising partners** have called the revitalized design "attractive" - the new layouts increase ad revenue potential.

**Editorial agility** - teams can now create and manage landing pages without engineering involvement.
