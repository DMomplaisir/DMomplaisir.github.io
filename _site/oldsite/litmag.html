        <h1>the Impact</h1>
        <span>nyc high school advertising campaign competition</span>
        <h2>the big question -</h2>
        <h3>how can we inspire more college students of color to teach in NYC public high schools?</h3>
        <h2>process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>speaking to and interviewing college-age students in nyc region who are repulsed by the idea of teaching, and teaching program students (speak to our extremes) </li>
          <li>
            interviewing teachers within our high school to determine what makes them come back every day, and what makes them hate their job
          </li>
          <li>
            considered current programs/advertising campaigns for teachers in the national/global scale
          </li>
          <li>
            recorded sessions with teachers, and student interviews to find connections between their experiences
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>conclusions made</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            realized a huge disconnect between college students perception of the role, and impact of good teachers
          </li>
          <li>
            found students wanted to "change the world", and impact the communties around them in some means
          </li>
          <li>
            a way to engage students best is through Youtube content, Instagram sponsored content, and real stories. authencity is key to making connections
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>what did we do?</h2>
        <p>
          developed a ad campaign called THEIMPACT fixated on personal narratives of teachers of color, and connecting it to the main feelings of angst towards becoming a teacher. primarily did easily shareable static content on instagram, and twitter but also developed a series of video interviews with teachers of color in order to develop long-form content which would students would be able to connect to deeper. our main aim was on developing awareness of the possiblity of career path as teacher, and realize this would be a position where they would be able to impact students directly, and "change the world".
