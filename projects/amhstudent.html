            <h3>background</h3>
            <P>The Amherst Student is the oldest college newspaper in the nation, and has been reporting about the Amherst College community since 1868 but its digital presence
                remained an obstacle in reaching its audience.They had a dated website which
                wasn’t responsive making it difficult for our mobile audience to access content, and an unwieldy content management system which made editors unable to experiment
                with new designs, or more interactive elements.
            </P>
            <p>
                As an avid reader of the paper, I was always irritated going to the website and sent an email over in early Spring 2017 complaining to the editors-in-chief. These
                conversations ended up led to me becoming the paper’s Digital Director with my first project
                - being rearchitecting our news website to support a better user experience for writers and editors, and transition our brand to a modern yet classic digital
                identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This would be the first of many projects spanning from our website, newsletters to managing a social media team but I’ll focus on website development.

            <h3>discovery</h3>
            <p>We began this road to rearchitecting the Student’s digital identity with a discovery stage where I focused purely on understanding this project by communicating with
                stakeholders on the history of the organization, and its digital presence,
                and their hopes and dreams of this new initiative.</p>
            <p>Speaking to the Editors-in-Chief, I learned of the prior financial troubles of the organization, and hopes to re-become an independent newspaper. They viewed this
                project as a clear sign of their organizational transformation, and saw that
                it could possibly increase the impact the student newspaper had. The prior website was impossible to change and upgrade without outside technical support leaving
                them in a state where the site didn’t really feel like their own. This sentiment
                was felt with the section editors as well who just wanted to be able to add interactive elements in an article, and feel they were creating the look of their
                article, not the other way around.</p>

            <blockquote>
                “It’s ugly and looks old. Gets spammed constantly. Hard to search for past articles. Best content doesn’t appear at top. Photos are TINY. Stupid temperature thing.
                The link to the blog even though we haven’t had a blog update in years. A lot of weird
                blank space. Font is boring and looks old-fashioned. Color-scheme is gross. Info at bottom of comment section about text format — UNNECESSARY. Missing important
                info about the paper and masthead."
            </blockquote>
            <p>After speaking with the editors, I spent time researching how people engaged with our paper in the physical form, social media, and generally the website. Without an
                analytics package on the site, it was difficult to do comparisons but qualitative
                research around perception of the paper provided a lot of insight as a lot of people didn’t know who we were on campus yet might have viewed an article of ours, or
                have had conversations around those articles. They found the content amazing
                but were reasonably annoyed when they couldn’t read our articles on their phones without zooming in a lot.
            </p>
            <P>I tried initially to tinker with our current CMS, and website in order to see if we could do some minimal effort tasks with large impact but I discovered a Drupal 6
                install where the admin passwords weren’t allowed to actual update or change
                plugins where it took me days just to learn that. I realized this was not sustainable, and the reason the website hadn’t updated since 2007 wasn’t out of a lack of
                want or technically skilled people but merely it was too confusing to invest
                time into.</P>
            <p>With all of these in mind and clear chain of command being established, I had a good grasp of the issues I was solving for and knew where to start.</p>

            <h3>design process</h3>
            <h2>How do we extend our brand into a digital publication?</h2>
            <p>We were craving a new design for our website but the conversation became quite difficult as our prior website didn’t approach this conversation with intention, and
                as a result it felt more like a design of its time, rather than a timeless
                design. Coming from a print background, this was an extremely interesting question. So, I began this design process by collecting other news media organizations
                websites, and using Dropmark to pass it to the website’s standing committee
                to see where their vision lied.</p>
            <a href="https://codeburgundy.dropmark.com/543914">
                <div class="hero img2">
                    <img src="../assets/designdreamboard.png" alt="" srcset="" />
                </div>
            </a>
            <!-- Images -->
            <p>I quickly learned I was a bit too fixated on making the Student look like a new media organization such as Vox, and the response was pretty clear with some of my
                favorite options being called;</p>
            <blockquote>
                “just think those are much more magaziney, while we are much more newspaper oriented.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>With this in mind, I finally understood where they were coming from, and shifted techniques. I went to the drawing board and detailed the information architecture of
                the website, and started plotting out some lo-fidelity designs. I spent time
                thinking more about the article page, and mistaken when straight to hi-fi for the homepage.</p>

            <p>
                When thinking about the front-page, I found myself looking at the LA Times website which utilizes the card layout in a manner which still retained its classic
                identity but still provided a modern twist which people are used to in the mobile context. A
                request I had yielded from the editors was the capacity to shift and change the homepage easily, and with this design - creating the front page was merely just
                setting front-page cards to an article. As I progressed with designing the
                front-page, I went back and tried to mimic this style on all other pages. Check out on Figma.

            <h3>development thoughts</h3>
            <h2>How do we create a publishing platform which is easy-to-use for the newsroom but also agile enough to
                support testing out new ideas?</h2>
            <p>My biggest priority was I wanted to ensure that our publishing pipeline would be open, simple to comprehend organization-wide and support agile development. Our
                prior website had a lot of opportunities but its technical architecture didn’t
                support continuous improvement rather forcing a one and done model. Additionally, it was written in PHP - a language most students at Amherst aren’t familiar with
                and I really wanted to utilize this project as a way to involve the tech
                community at Amherst.</p>
            <p>Seeing that flaw, I wanted to stick to utilizing Javascript and HTML/CSS, and began looking around how larger organizations have their website setup. That’s when I
                found an article from the NiemanLab speaking about their transition away from
                the waterfall development to a new platform Vi using React, and GraphQL which allowed them to adjust the site on the fly and react to feedback faster. It sounded
                interesting and doing a test version of the design for the article page -
                it felt extremely intutiive, and comfortable. I realized the model of headless CMS, and a seperate server-rendered React app was the model news organizations were
                moving towards as it allowed them a level of flexibility which coupled CMS’s
                don’t.</p>
            <p>With this technical architecture in mind, I began building the website with Next.js (a server-side rendering React frontend framework) utilizing Strapi as our CMS
                and Graphql as our query language between the two.</p>
