        <h1>so, about me</h1>
        <p>There isn't an Apple Store in the Amazon, and you can't wait for
          Customer Service when you're trying to save lives. I believe that a
          combination of programming prowess, and understanding of user experience
          will allow us to build platforms for the next billion Internet users to
          speak their mind, build buisnesses, and live in a more interconnected
          world. </p>

        <p> When I'm not blabbing about User Experience, I intern at the Jewish
          Museum, teaching the public about the arts (mostly children) via art
          projects, tours, and physical lesssons. I'm also Editor in Chief of
          a magazine called LitMag, a literary magazine with a fifteen person team.
          Half of the hours in my week go to LitMag because I feel a duty to show
          the literary and artistic talents of teens. Click here to view our most
          recent magazine.</p>

        <p> Some odd hobbies are <em>attempting</em> to learn Arabic, being fluent
          in Haitian Creole, binge watching House of Cards, occasional acting, and
          loving jazz music. </p>
