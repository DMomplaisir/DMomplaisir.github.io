      <h1>about <span class="burgundy">me.</span></h1>
      <p>I'm Dylan Momplaisir, a junior at Amherst College majoring in Architectural Studies, and Computer Science. I'm
        the
        Digital Director of the Amherst Student (the oldest school newspaper in the country). I've been doing front-end
        web
        development and UI/UX design for about four years, and currently expanding into doing back-end development.
      </p>
      <p>Being born and raised in NYC, I've been raised around a world of inequality, and that's motivated me to use
        tech for
        public good, supporting people in engaging with civil activism (Root), and learning more about their world (the
        Amherst
        Student). I'm interested in doing work that provides people opportunities to utilize resources easier,
        simplifying
        people's day to day work, and providing unique, interactive experiences which allow people to create more.
      </p>
