    <h1>about <span class="burgundy">me.</span></h1>
    <p>I'm Dylan Momplaisir, a senior at Amherst College majoring in Architectural Studies, and Computer Science. I work as the Digital Director on the Amherst Student, the oldest school newspaper. I've been doing
      web development and UI/UX design for about six years, and have recently expanded into doing machine learning (specifically natural language processing).  
    </p>
    <p>Being born and raised in NYC, I've been raised around a world of inequality, and that's motivated me to use
      tech for public good, supporting people in engaging with civil activism (Root), and learning more about their world (the
      Amherst Student). I'm interested in doing work that provides people opportunities to utilize resources easier,
      simplifying people's day to day work, and providing unique, interactive experiences which allow people to create more.
    </p>
