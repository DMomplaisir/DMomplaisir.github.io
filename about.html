      <h1>so, about me</h1>
      <p>There isn't an Apple Store in the Amazon, and you can't wait for
        Customer Service when you're trying to save lives. I believe that a
        combination of programming prowess, and understanding of user experience
        will allow us to build platforms for the next billion Internet users to
        speak their mind, build buisnesses, and live in a more interconnected
        world. </p>

      <p> When I'm not blabbing about User Experience, I intern at the Jewish
        Museum, teaching the public about the arts (mostly children) via art
        projects, tours, and physical lesssons.
